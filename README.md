# Pacman-Search-Project
This project implements several search algorithms to control Pacman in a variety of mazes. The goal is to navigate Pacman efficiently through the maze using different search strategies, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and A* search.
