# Pacman Search Project

This project implements several search algorithms to control Pacman in a variety of mazes. The goal is to navigate Pacman efficiently through the maze using different search strategies, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and A* search. These algorithms help Pacman find paths to reach food or escape ghosts.

## Overview
In this project, Pacman is placed in various maze environments, where the task is to guide him to the goal (usually a piece of food or exit) using different search strategies. The project is designed to test and explore how these algorithms perform in different scenarios.

Pacmanâ€™s world is made up of walls, empty spaces, food, and sometimes ghosts. The search algorithms need to find the optimal or near-optimal paths in this world while navigating obstacles.

## Implemented Algorithms
This project includes the following search algorithms, all implemented in Python:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores the deepest nodes in the search tree first.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores the shallowest nodes first, ensuring the shortest path.
- **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**: Expands the least-cost node first.
- **A Search (A\*)**: Combines UCS with a heuristic to improve search efficiency.
  
Each algorithm is implemented in the `search.py` file, and the agents controlling Pacman are in the `searchAgents.py` file.

## Results
The table below summarizes the performance of the A* search algorithm on _Eating all the dots_ for different maze layouts:

| Layout         | Search Nodes Expanded | Total Cost | Time Taken (seconds) |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| trickySearch   | 719                   | 60         | 7.9                  |
| tinySearch     | 911                   | 27         | 2.3                  |

You can reproduce these results by running the following commands:

```bash
python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent
 ```

```bash
python pacman.py -l tinySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent
```

## How to Run the Project
To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lienertdemaeyer/Pacman-Search-Project
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Pacman-Search-Project
   ```

3. Run Pacman with different search algorithms by using the following commands:

   ### Depth-First Search (DFS):
   Depth-First Search explores the deepest nodes in the search tree first.

   To run Pacman using DFS on the tinyMaze layout, run:
   ```bash
   python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch
   ```

   ### Breadth-First Search (BFS):
   Breadth-First Search explores the shallowest nodes first, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.

   To run Pacman using BFS on the mediumMaze layout, run:
   ```bash
   python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=breadthFirstSearch
   ```

   ### Uniform-Cost Search (UCS):
   Uniform-Cost Search expands the least-cost node first, prioritizing paths with the smallest cost.

   To run Pacman using UCS on the bigMaze layout, run:
   ```bash
   python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=uniformCostSearch
   ```

   ### A* Search (A*):
   A* search combines the cost of a path (like UCS) with a heuristic to estimate the remaining cost to the goal.

   To run Pacman using A* search on the bigMaze layout with the Manhattan distance heuristic, run:
   ```bash
   python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=aStarSearch,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
   ```

   You can experiment with different layouts and algorithms by changing the `-l` (layout) and `-a` (algorithm) arguments.

   ### Example Layouts:
   - **tinyMaze**: A small, simple maze.
   - **mediumMaze**: A slightly larger and more complex maze.
   - **bigMaze**: A large maze that requires more efficient search strategies.

   ### Example Algorithms:
   - **Depth-First Search**: `depthFirstSearch`
   - **Breadth-First Search**: `breadthFirstSearch`
   - **Uniform-Cost Search**: `uniformCostSearch`
   - **A\* Search**: `aStarSearch`

4. To check if your implementation is correct, you can run the autograder:
   ```bash
   python autograder.py
   ```
   This will run tests for each search algorithm to verify correctness and performance.

### What Each Command Does:
- **`python pacman.py`**: Runs the Pacman game.
- **`-l tinyMaze`**: Specifies the layout/maze Pacman will navigate.
- **`-p SearchAgent`**: Specifies the type of agent controlling Pacman. In this case, the `SearchAgent` which uses search algorithms.
- **`-a fn=depthFirstSearch`**: Specifies the search function to use (DFS, BFS, UCS, or A*).
  - For A*, you can also specify a **heuristic** (e.g., `manhattanHeuristic`), which helps estimate the cost to reach the goal.


## Files and Directories
- **`search.py`**: Contains the implementations of search algorithms.
- **`searchAgents.py`**: Contains the agents that use the search algorithms to control Pacman.
- **`pacman.py`**: The main file to run the game.
- **`autograder.py`**: Autograder for testing the correctness of your implementations.

## Autograder
To run the autograder and check if your implementations are correct, use:
```bash
python autograder.py
```
